* Usage

+ =hddtemp-lt= :: Show temps for all =sd= and =nvme= disks.
+ =hddtemp-lt /dev/sda ...= :: Show temps for selected disks

Options:

- =-h, --help= :: Show usage
- =-q= :: Suppress warnings
- =-V, --version= :: Show version

Output is aligned into columns. Device models can contain spaces like
/WDC WD10EFRX-68FYTN0/ or /Samsung SSD 950 PRO 256GB/ so fields are
separated with at least two spaces.

* Requirements

- =smartctl= (=smartmontools= package)
  - NVMe support: =smartctl= v6.5+

* Installation

Fetch the archive either from releases or from the development branch
and put =hddtemp-lt= under =/usr/local/bin/=

In case you downloaded the script alone from github by a raw link, be
sure to manually make it executable.

If you'd like point a =hddtemp= symlink to it:

#+begin_example
  sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/hddtemp{-lt,}
#+end_example
